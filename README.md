Topos uses AI to develop a holistic understanding of location. A scraper is written in python (jupyer notebook) to collect data from Wikipedia about the top cities in the United States. The fields collected, as well as the volume of data is done independently, but additional data beyond the initial table is also added. The final format is a CSV file that is uploaded to a BigQuery table and prepared using BigQuery Manual
